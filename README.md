## Running the site locally
 - [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/)
 - [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
 - `cd dublinjs.github.com`  <-- wherever you cloned this repo
 - `jekyll serve`
 - open http://localhost:4000
 - If you make a change to a post or anything, you'll probably need to run `jekyll build` to update the site locally
