# Code of Conduct
DublinJS is a developer group for anyone interested in Javascript in Ireland. All skill levels are welcome. Please get in touch if you want to get involved!

A primary goal of DublinJS is to be inclusive to the largest number of people, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in DublinJS to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Our Conduct
 - Be welcoming and friendly.
 - Be respectful.
 - Be careful with the words you choose. Be kind to others and do not engage in behaviour which may be exclusionary or insulting. This includes, but is not limited to: 
   - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
   - Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
   - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
   - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
   - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
   - Unwelcome sexual attention.
   - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
   - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
 - If at any time you witness unacceptable behaviour or are made to feel uncomfortable, please don't hesitate to contact one of the [organisers](http://www.meetup.com/DublinJS/members/?op=leaders), who will introduce themselves at the beginning of each meetup.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, the community organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community.
